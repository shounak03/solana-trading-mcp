## Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This is a demonstration/development tool with simulated trading. In a production environment, you would integrate with actual DEXes (like Jupiter, Raydium) or CEXes for real trading functionality.

The server runs on Solana Devnet by default, which means any transactions are simulated and don't affect real funds.
